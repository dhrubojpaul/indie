            "Visualization tools can take advantage of multiple coordinated views to support analysis of large, multidimensional data sets. Effective design of such views and layouts can be challenging, but understanding users' analysis strategies can inform design improvements. Visual analytics methods are needed to capture and learn from user interaction data to understand analysis behavior."

            "Advancements in machine learning provide powerful methods for automated data processing and support for data analysis, but such methods can be complicated, and many people do not trust methods they do not understand. This research investigates methods for supporting transparency and providing explanations of how and why algorithms provide the output that they do. New XAI (eXplainable Artificial Intelligence) techniques are needed to provide more interpretable machine models, and new empirical studies are needed to better understand how different types of explanations influence human understanding and trust of computational systems."

            "In many virtual reality applications, it would be ideal if users could use their physical hands to directly interact with virtual objects while experiencing realistic haptic feedback. While this can beachieved via interaction with tracked physical props that correspond to virtual objects, practical limitations make it difficult to achieve a physical environment that exactly represents the virtual world. Our research explores methods for using physical objects and haptic feedback for object interactions."

            "Virtual reality systems often allow users to use natural, physical body movements to view and interact with 3D environments. In certain situations, however, it may not be practical or desirable to require completely realistic physical interaction. Our research explores travel techniques that balance naturalness and comfort."

            "Virtual simulations are commonly used to educate and train for real-world scenarios. We study how various virtual reality displays and interaction techniques affect learning and training transfer. By taking advantage of both head-mounted displays and surround-screen projection systems, we evaluate how different types of travel and viewing techniques affect information retention, training transfer, sickeness, and the ability to maintain spatial orientation within complex 3D spaces."
