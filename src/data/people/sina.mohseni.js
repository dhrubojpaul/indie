    description: [
        "I am a Computer Science Ph.D. candidate at Texas A&M University. I am pursuing my PhD working with Dr. Eric Ragan from University of Florida and Dr. Ben Hu from Texas A&M University. My PhD research is on Explainable AI (or interpretable machine learning) topic, which I study ways to design and evaluate Explainable AI systems as a part of the DARPA XAI program. I also work on machine learning safety topic and published papers on different deep learning techniques to improve model trustworthiness and dependability. Besides these, I have a background in visual analytic, crowdsourcing techniques, and user behavior analysis.",
        "I have always been seeking to solve deep problems in my research and have never given up on my ideas. I believe being creative, goal-oriented, and hardworking helped me the most throughout my research. I have collaborated with engineers and scientists in my field while working at  Bosch and  Nvidia and collaborating remotely with  University of Florida. Prior to joining  Texas A&M, I was studying at  Oregon State University. I studied M.Sc. in Electronic Systems Engineering at Babol Noshirvany university of Technology (working on computer vision and optimization algorithms) and earned my B.Sc. in Electrical and Electronic Engineering from University of Isfahan, Iran."
